## Abstract
**given:**<br/>
* Web browsing data
* 156(115 pro Trump, 41 pro Clinton) fake news stories gathered by fact-checking websites
* results from a new 1200-person post-election online survey

The following conculsions are made with respect to the three months before the election:
1. Social media was an important but not dominant news source, the most important source
  for 14% of people.
2. Of all known fake news stories in that period, those favoring Trump were shared 30M
  times on Facebook, those favoring Clinton 7.6M times.
3. The average American adult saw on the order of 1 to several fake news stories, with
  just above half of those who recalled seeing them believing them.
4. People are much more likely to believe in stories that favor their preferred
  candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.

## Introduction

* 19th century 
  + cheap newsprint => expansion of partisan newspapers 
    - press was no longer an effective check on power
    (kaplan 2002)
* 20th century 
  + radio and television 
    - reduction of substansive policy debates to sound bites
      - privilege telegenic over unpolished leaders
        - concentrate power in the hands of a few corporations
     (Lang and Lang 2002; Bagdikian 1983)
* early 21st
  + online news
    - excessive diversity of viewpoints
      - echo chambers and filter bubbles
     (Sunstein 2001a, b, 2007; Pariser 2001)
* nowadays
  + social media
    - an individual with no track, reputation, third party filtering, fact-checking, 
    or editorial judgment can reach as many readers as Fox News, CNN, or NYT

Following the 2019 election, the Fake news circulated on social media got attention
1. 62% of US adults get news on social media (Gottfied and Shearer 2016)
2. Most popular fake news were more widely shared than the most popular mainstream
    news (Silverman 2016)
3. Many people who see them believe them (Silverman and Singer-Vine 2016)
4. The most discussed fake news stories tended to favor Trump over Clinton (Silverman
   2016)
5. Some suggest that Trump wouldn't have won the election were it not for the influence
   of fake news (Parkinson 2016, Read 2016, Dewey 2016)

### An economic model of fake news:
* Firms gather and sell signals of a true state of the world to consumers who benefit
    from inferring that state.
* Fake news is conceptualized as distorted signals, **uncorrelated** with the truth.
* Fake news exists since 
  * It's cheaper to provide than precise signals.
  * Consumers can't constlessly infer accuracy.
  * Consumers may enjoy partisan news.
* Fake news may generate utility for some customers but imposes private and social
    costs by making it more difficult to infer the state of the world and thus, for 
    instance make it more difficult for voters to find the candidate they prefer.

### Some facts
1. Social media referrals had a small share of traffic on mainstream news sites, but a much
larger share on fake news sites.
2. People trust traditional outlets more than social media (the most important source
for only 14% of people).
3. The 38M shares of fake news in the database translate into 760M clicks, 3 stories per
   American adult.
4. A list of fake news websites on which just over half of the articles appear to be
   false received 159M visits during the month of election, 0.64 per US adult.
5. ~15% of the respondents in the post-election survey recalled seeings each of 15 major
   pre-election fake news headlines. But ~14% also recalled seeing a set of placebo
   headlines that never actually circulated from the difference of recal rates between
   real headlines and placebo ones it was concluded that an average US adult remembered
   1.14 fake stories.
6. Democrats and Republicans are both ~15% more likely to believe ideologically aligned
   headlines. This number is substantially higher for people with ideologically
   segregated social media networks.

### Background: The market for Fake News:
#### Definition 
**Fake news :=** news that are intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead readers
#### Things that are not fake news:
**rumors :=** “claims of fact—about people, groups, events, and 
institutions—that have not been shown to be true, but that move from one person to 
another, and hence have credibility not because direct evidence is available to 
support them, but because other people seem to believe them.” (Sunstein 2007)

**conspiracy theory :=** “a proposed explanation of some historical event (or events)
in terms of the significant causal agency of a relatively small group of persons the 
conspirators––acting in secret.” (Keeley 1999)

**satire**

**False statements by politicians**

**reports that are slanted or misleading but not outright false** (in the language of Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Stone 2016, fake news is “distortion,” not “filtering”).

#### History
Fake news has been there since at least 1835, however, it seems like that it's gaining
importance these days specially in the US for a few reasons:
* Reputational concerns discourage mass media ourlets from knowingly reporting false
    stories, thus, a higher barrier to entry to the media industry limits false
    reporting. Nowadays, creating websites has become very easy so is monatizing them
    through online advertisement, dramatically reducing the barrier to entry to the
    market and increasing the production of fake news.
* Social media are well suited for distributing fake news.
* Gallup polls reveal a continuing decline of "trust and confidence" in the mass media
    when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately, and fairly". Especially in
    republicans with a sharp drop in 2016, which could be both a cause and consequence
    of fake news gaining more traction.
* Political
